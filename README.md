## Testing Environment 

The code is tested on Ubuntu 18.04.3 with Python 3.7.4.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

To run the code in the tutorial locally, it is recommended, 
- a dedicated GPU suitable for running, and
- install Anaconda. 

The following python packages are required to run the code. 
- `cma==2.7.0`
- `matplotlib==3.1.1`
- `numpy==1.17.2`
- `pandas==0.25.1`
- `scipy==1.4.1`
- `seaborn==0.9.0`
- `tensorflow==2.1.0`

---

### Steps

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shashankkotyan/DualQualityAssessment.git
cd ./DualQualityAssessment
```

2. Create a virtual environment 

```bash
conda create --name dqa python=3.7.4
conda activate dqa
```

3. Install the python packages in `requirements.txt` if you don't have them already.

```bash
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

4. Run an adversarial attack with the following command.

    a) Run the Pixel Attack with the following command

    ```bash
    python -u run_attack.py pixel [ARGS] > run.txt
    ```

    b) Run the Threshold Attack with the following command

    ```bash
    python -u run_attack.py threshold [ARGS] > run.txt
    ```

5. Calculate the statstics for the attacks.

```bash
python -u run_stats.py > run_stats.txt     
```
